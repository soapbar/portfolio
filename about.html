      <p>
        Hi! My name is Sophie He. I got my English name when I went to daycare in Quebec; no one could pronounce my Chinese name, so my mom wanted me to be wise and called me 'Sophie'. My Chinese name, Bin Ru (彬汝）, was given to me on the day I was born. 'Bin' （彬） is from the Chinese idiom, 彬彬有礼, which means refined and courteous. After taking Korean in college, a close Korean friend gave me a Korean name, 소희 (So-hee), meaning bright. I believe that all these names define who I am and who I want to be.

      <p>
        我是在上海 1998年出身. 因为呢时候中国有独生子女政策， 2岁的时候搬到加拿大， 生了我的妹妹。Au Québec, J'ai étudié le français pendant six ans. In third grade, I came to the United States, where I lived in San Antonio, Texas, and just like everyone else in the city, I loved the Spurs. 고등학교보터 한국 음악과 한국 드라마 미국과 너무 달라서 관심이 생겼다. 지금 대학에서 한국어 배우고 한국어 정말 아름답다고 생각한다.

        This is what I've experienced in the life I've had so far, and as for the rest of it, I'll have to decide where to take it. As Dumbledore once said: “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

        Trans: I was born in Shanghai, China in 1998, and lived there for two years. Because of China's One Child Policy at the time, we moved to Quebec, Canada and there, my sister was born. French is one of Quebec's official languages, so I spoke French in school until we moved to the United States when I was eight years old. In third grade, I came to the United States, where I lived in San Antonio, Texas, and just like everyone else in the city, I loved the Spurs [basketball team in San Antonio]. In high school, I became interested in Korean music and dramas and became more interested in Korean culture. Now, I'm in college studying Korean, and the more I learn about it, the more beautiful I think it is.
