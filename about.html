        ...I say often without hestitation. <br/>
        Although I am still uncertain about many things, I am certain of my name, my identity, and all my past experiences that have shaped the "Sophie" I am today.
        Of my many names, I go by "Sophie" most often, a name that represents a characteristic that my mother wanted me to have: wisdom.
        "Bin Ru (彬汝）", my Chinese name, was given to me on the day I was born, with a meaning of politeness and consideration from the Chinese idiom 彬彬有礼.
        After taking Korean language in college, a close Korean friend gave me another name, "소희 (So-hee)", meaning bright.
        All of these names I associate with myself and are representations of what I am and what I strive to be.

      <p>
        我是在上海 1998年出身的。虽然2岁的时候搬到了加拿大， 但是我还能听懂上海话!
        Au Québec, J'ai étudié le français pendant six ans.
        In third grade, I came to the United States, which felt exactly the same as Canada, but yet completely different at the same time.
        고등학교보터 한국 음악과 드라마들 처음 봤고 미국 문화와 너무 달라서 관심이 생겼다. 지금 대학에서 한국어 배우고 있고 너무 재미 있다고 생각한다!
        I realized that I enjoy learning new languages because it allows me to communicate and empathize with people all around the world.

        Trans: I was born in Shanghai in 1998.
        Even though I moved to Canada when I was two years old, I can still understand Shanghainese (the Shanghai dialect)!
        French is one of Quebec's official languages, so I spoke French in school until we moved to the United States when I was eight years old.
        In third grade, I came to the United States, which felt exactly the same as Canada, but yet completely different at the same time.
        In high school, I got introduced to Korean culture contents (K-pop, Korean drama) and it felt so new to me, yet I felt like I could relate to the content as well.
        In college I have been taking Korean language classes, and it's so fun!
        I realized that I enjoy learning new languages because it allows me to communicate and empathize with people all around the world.
